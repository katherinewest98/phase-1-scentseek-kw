# Phase 1 Project - ScentSeek

This SPA, ScentSeek, replicates a basic e-commerce intended to help users find perfumes. The user can search by product name or brand, mouseover the product image to see a breakdown of the perfume notes, and click the button on each card to add the product to their bag, which is reflected in the bag count.
